I'm a Software and Machine Learning Engineer, I like to mess around with data, and stretch the use cases of cloud computing. I also know how to build web apps using Javascript. I'm a serverless advocate ðŸ˜Š.

I'm currently working on improving collaboration on Medical apps and devices at [Medherd](https://medherd.com), where I do a lot of these things.
