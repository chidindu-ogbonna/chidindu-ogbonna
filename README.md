I'm a Data Scientist and Software Developer, I like to mess around with data, and stretch the use cases of cloud computing. I build of frontends using Javascript, I also do serverless and deploy models to the cloud built with Python.

I'm currently working on improving collaboration on Medical apps and devices at [Medherd](https://medherd.com), where I do a lot of these things.

## What else do I do ðŸ¤” ? 
I write about data, machine learning and technology on my [blog](https://chidinduogbonna.com/blog), and I've built a few projects based on these topics.
