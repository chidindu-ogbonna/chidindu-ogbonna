I'm a Software and Machine Learning Engineer. I like to mess around with data, and stretch the use cases of cloud computing. I also know how to build web apps using Javascript and I'm in love with the serverless paradigm.

My mission is to build practical Machine Learning applications.

I'm currently working on improving collaboration on Medical apps and devices at [Medherd](https://medherd.com), where I do a lot of these things.

## Interesting things I've built ðŸ¤“ 
* [Threadspeaker](https://twitter.com/threadspeaker) - A twitter bot that converts tweets to audio.
* [Is This Jollof ?](https://isthisjollof.com) - A machine learning service that identifies if a plate food is jollof rice or not.

## Other things I do
* [A Blog](https://chidinduogbonna.com/blog) - I write about data, machine learning and technology 
* [EverythingML](https://everythingml.com) - A newsletter called on the important things you need to know about ML and Data Science in production.
